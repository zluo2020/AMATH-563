HOMEWORK1 (MNIST DATASET)
1. Using various AX = B solvers, determine a mapping from the image space to the label space
2. By promoting sparsity, determine and rank which pixels in the MNIST set are most informative for correctly labeling the digits. 
   (You’ll have to come up with your own heuristics or empirical rules for this. Use pcolor to help you visualize the results from X) 
3. Apply your most important pixels to the test data set to see how accurate you are with as few pixels as possible.
4. Redo the analysis with each digit individually to ﬁnd the most important pixels for each digit.
